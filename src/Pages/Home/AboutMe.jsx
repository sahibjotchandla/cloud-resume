            I'm a Computer Engineering student based in the GTA, studying at the University of Guelph. I'm really interested in how tech can bring ideas to life, whether it's through cloud solutions or working with data to solve real problems. I like exploring how we can use technology to make things more efficient, whether that's automating everyday tasks or improving how we work with information. Lately, I've been especially focused on data systems, cloud platforms, and the impact of AI in the real world. Outside of engineering, I spend time with my family and my dog, watch sports, and play video games. For me, tech has always been about more than just code. It's about building things that actually make life easier and more enjoyable.            </p>
